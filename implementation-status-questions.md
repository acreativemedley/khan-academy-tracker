# Implementation Status Questions for TODO List Creation

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Purpose:** Clarify current implementation state to create accurate TODO list

## Questions About Current Implementation Status

### 1. Course Data Import Status
The PROJECT_PLAN mentions different completion statuses for courses:
- **Integrated Math 3**: Claims to be "fully documented" but only Unit 1 is imported (34 activities)
This is correct, the file course-data\math-data-formatted.md documents all activities, but only Unit 1 is imported into the database
- **High School Chemistry**: Says "needs fixing" - what's the current data state?
The data in the course-data folder is incomplete or incorrect. It needs to be updated/verified before it can be imported into the database
- **World History & 10th Grade Reading**: Say "needs data fixing" - are these imported at all?
Same as chemistry

**Question:** What is the actual current state of course data import for each course? Which courses have data in the database and which need to be imported?

Math Unit 1 is in the database, the rest is documented but needs to be imported. THe other classes may have some data in the database, but it should not be considered correct or up to date

**Answer:**

### 2. TargetDateSettings Component
The status mentions this is implemented for "flexible target date management" but also says "Database update functionality not working through UI". 

This functionality is now working and the project plan should be updated to reflect that

**Question:** What is the current state of the TargetDateSettings component?
- Is it built but not functional?
- Partially working?
- What specific issues exist with the database updates?

**Answer:** 
This should all be working now

### 3. Schedule Calculation Engine
The plan mentions this needs to be implemented to:
- Calculate due dates for activities
- Handle fractional daily targets (e.g., 1.3 activities/day)
- Respect exam days in scheduling
- Show activities with assigned dates

**Question:** Is ANY schedule calculation logic currently implemented, or does this entire system need to be built from scratch?

**Answer:** 
This entire system needs to be built from scratch - before that can be done though, you need more information about how I want it to work.

### 4. Progress Tracking System
Claims "checkbox functionality for marking activities complete (WORKING)" but also says "Task completion system only has one task complete".

The checkbox functionality works for testing, but it is not currently tied to any student.

**Question:** What's the actual current state of progress tracking?
- Do checkboxes work to mark activities complete?
Yes, but not tied to any student
- Is completion data being saved to the database?
- What does "only has one task complete" mean?

**Answer:** 
Do we need to create a student to meaningfully implement this? This app will currently only be used for one student, so we can either create his profile or create a test student. Would this be a good time to create user authentication so we can make sure it works as intended?

### 5. Authentication System
Says "Currently bypassed for development".

**Question:** Should the TODO list include implementing authentication, or should we continue development without it for now? What's the priority level?

**Answer:** 
Todo list should absolutely include implementing authentication. See my answer to #4 for priority setting

### 6. Individual vs Global Target Dates
Recent conversation mentions removing hardcoded "May 30, 2026" and implementing individual course target dates.

**Question:** What is the current state of individual course target dates?
- Is this fully implemented and working?
- Partially implemented?
- Can users actually set different target dates per course and have them save to the database?

**Answer:** 

Individual course target dates appear to be working

### 7. Calendar/Scheduling Views
**Question:** Are there any calendar or daily schedule views currently implemented, or do these need to be built entirely?

**Answer:** 
There are NO calendar or daily schedule views currently implemented
---

### 8. Core React Components Status
**Question:** Which of these components are currently working vs need to be built/fixed?
- StudentDashboard: Created, but not fully functional because some of the functions that support it do not exist
- CourseDetail: Task list is implemented but without due dates
- ProgressCharts: Exist but will need to be reworked once the full database is implemented - low priority
- Navigation: working so far
- TargetDateSettings: appears to be functioning as desired

**Answer:** 

---

### 9. Database Schema & Connectivity
**Question:** Is the Supabase database fully set up and connected? Are there any database schema issues or missing tables?

**Answer:** 
Database is fully set up, the activities are not populated for the most part. I am not aware of any missing tables, we may discover we need others as we progress. I would guess that we will continue to run into RLS issues, that seems to be a persistent struggle. If things are not functioning as expected, that should always be a consideration
---

### 10. Priority Focus Areas
**Question:** What are the TOP 3 most important features/areas that need to be completed first to make this application functional for actual use?

**Answer:** 
Importing the full list for all classes
Adding dates individual activities
being able to add vacation days so that my student is not penalized for taking permitted time off

## Instructions for Completion
Please answer each question with specific details about what's currently working, what's broken, and what needs to be built. This will help create a comprehensive and accurate TODO list that focuses on actual needs rather than assumptions.
