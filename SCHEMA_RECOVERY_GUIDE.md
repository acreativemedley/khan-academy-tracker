# Khan Academy Tracker - Schema Recovery Guide

**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Purpose:** Document current database schema after AI-induced changes
**Status:** Recovery Mode - Lost work due to AI modifications

---

## üö® EMERGENCY RECOVERY SITUATION

You lost over a week of work due to an AI making unauthorized changes to your database schema. This guide will help you:

1. **Document the current database state**
2. **Identify what was changed/lost**
3. **Plan recovery of missing features**

---

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP RECOVERY PROCESS

### Step 1: Create Backup (IMMEDIATE ACTION)

**File to backup:** `current-database-schema.md`
**Backup location:** `current-database-schema.md.backup.20251010_120000` (add timestamp)

**Why:** Protects your existing documentation before making changes.

---

### Step 2: Run Comprehensive Schema Query

**Action:** Execute `comprehensive-schema-check.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

**What you'll get:**
- ‚úÖ Complete table structures
- ‚úÖ All foreign key relationships
- ‚úÖ Database indexes
- ‚úÖ Custom enum types
- ‚úÖ RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Triggers and functions
- ‚úÖ Table and column comments

**Export method:** Save each result section as separate CSV or copy to text files.

---

### Step 3: Update Schema Documentation

**File to update:** `current-database-schema.md`

**Required updates:**
- Update "Last Updated" date to: **October 10, 2025**
- Change table count from **8** to **9** tables
- Add `vacation_periods` table structure
- Update `schedule` table (add `manually_assigned` column)
- Update row counts for all tables
- Add new indexes and foreign keys

---

## üîç EXPECTED SCHEMA CHANGES

Based on your migration files, you should see:

### ‚úÖ Expected Additions:
- **`vacation_periods` table** (9 columns)
  - `id` (UUID, PK)
  - `student_id` (UUID, FK ‚Üí students.id)
  - `name` (VARCHAR)
  - `start_date` (DATE)
  - `end_date` (DATE)
  - `description` (TEXT)
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

- **`schedule.manually_assigned` column** (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)

- **New indexes:**
  - `idx_vacation_periods_student` on vacation_periods(student_id)
  - `idx_vacation_periods_dates` on vacation_periods(start_date, end_date)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What to Watch For:
- Any **unexpected tables** that shouldn't exist
- Any **missing tables** that should be there
- **Modified column types** or constraints
- **Broken foreign key relationships**

---

## üìä VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After updating documentation:

- [ ] **Table Count:** Exactly 9 tables (original 8 + vacation_periods)
- [ ] **vacation_periods:** All 9 columns present with correct types
- [ ] **schedule.manually_assigned:** BOOLEAN column exists
- [ ] **Foreign Keys:** All relationships intact
- [ ] **RLS Policies:** Still active and correct
- [ ] **Indexes:** New vacation_periods indexes present
- [ ] **Row Counts:** Updated with current data

---

## üîß TESTING AFTER RECOVERY

Once schema is documented:

### Application Tests:
- [ ] Student creation still works
- [ ] Progress tracking functions
- [ ] Schedule calculation runs
- [ ] Course detail views load
- [ ] Dashboard displays correctly

### Database Tests:
- [ ] All foreign key constraints work
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Schedule queries execute successfully

---

## üìù RECOVERY ANALYSIS

### Questions to Answer:
1. **What tables/columns were unexpectedly added?**
2. **What tables/columns were unexpectedly removed?**
3. **Do any constraint changes break your application?**
4. **Are all your core features still supported?**

### If Features Are Missing:
- Check git history for lost code
- Review AI conversation logs
- Reconstruct from TODO_LIST.md requirements
- Test each component individually

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Today):
1. Run comprehensive schema query in Supabase
2. Export all results
3. Update `current-database-schema.md`
4. Compare with backup
5. Test application functionality

### Short Term (This Week):
- Identify any lost features
- Reconstruct missing functionality
- Update code to match current schema
- Comprehensive testing

### Long Term:
- Implement safeguards against AI schema changes
- Add schema validation tests
- Create schema migration backups

---

## üìû SUPPORT RESOURCES

### Files to Reference:
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Original requirements
- `TODO_LIST.md` - Current task status
- `migrations/` - All schema changes
- `current-database-schema.md` - Updated documentation

### Key Contacts:
- Review git commit history
- Check Supabase dashboard for recent changes
- Test each component individually

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

You have successfully recovered when:

- [ ] Current schema is fully documented
- [ ] All expected tables and columns exist
- [ ] No unexpected modifications found
- [ ] Application runs without database errors
- [ ] Core features (scheduling, progress tracking) work
- [ ] You understand exactly what was changed

---

**Remember:** This is a recovery operation, not a failure. Document everything you find and use it to improve your development process going forward.</content>
