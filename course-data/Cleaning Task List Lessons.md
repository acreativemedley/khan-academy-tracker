Cleaning Task List Lessons
Short summary — what failed, why, and what I did to fix it
What I tried that did not work

I first tried simple string-replacements (replace the full block containing the standard + surrounding lines) using an exact-match replace. Those attempts failed with “could not find matching text” because the file’s whitespace/line-breaks and punctuation didn’t exactly match the replacement strings.
I attempted to remove standards in one terminal PowerShell command (filter lines and rewrite the file). You cancelled that terminal run, so it didn’t complete.
I attempted one large patch that removed many standard lines in a single apply; that patch failed with “Invalid context” because the file changed between reads and the large-context match was no longer exact. (Large multi-line patches are brittle when the file changes or when exact context differs.)
Early on I had a file-read error because I gave a relative path to a read operation that required an absolute path; I corrected that and re-read with the full path.
Why those approaches failed

Exact string replace is brittle when the file contains subtle differences (extra whitespace, duplicated lines, or special/hard-to-see characters). My first replace attempts used blocks that didn’t match the file exactly.
One-shot, big patches are fragile since context must match exactly; any intervening change or mismatch causes the whole patch to fail.
You cancelled the terminal-based bulk rewrite before it could run.
What I did to make it work (successful sequence)

Inventory & planning

Ran a workspace grep to find every line that looked like a curriculum standard (lines starting with CCSS ELA:, RL., RI., L.) so I had an exact list of targets.
Read ELA-data.md into the editor to inspect surrounding lines and confirm exact formatting.
Conservative, incremental edits

Switched to small, targeted edits: I removed standard-only lines in small groups/patches with apply_patch, each patch only touching a small region with exact surrounding context. This avoids the brittle large-patch problem.
After each patch I re-read the file region to verify the change and ensure I didn’t accidentally delete neighboring content.
Repeated the small-patch process until all curriculum-standard-only lines were removed.

Used grep_search and repeated read_file checks to confirm standards were removed.
Updated the in-repo todo list to reflect progress and that the restore step was performed.
Notes about the final file state and why I didn’t do more

I removed only lines that were pure curriculum standards (the lines you asked to remove). I left surrounding labels and item lines (e.g., Article, Exercise · 4 questions, Assigned) unchanged.
Removing the standards left several duplicated neighbor lines in places (e.g., Article\nArticle or Exercise · 4 questions\nExercise · 4 questions). I intentionally didn’t deduplicate those automatically because that would be a semantic/formatting change beyond “remove standards only.” I can tidy duplicates on request.
I did not commit or push anything — the ELA-data.md edits are saved in the working tree for you to review.
