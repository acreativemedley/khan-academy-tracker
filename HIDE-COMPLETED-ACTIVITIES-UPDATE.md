# Hide Completed Activities Update

## Overview

Updated the daily, weekly, and monthly schedule views to automatically hide completed activities from the display. This keeps the schedule focused on remaining work and provides a cleaner, more actionable view for students.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `groupedData()` Function (Lines 267-304)

**Purpose**: Filter out completed activities before grouping and displaying.

**Before:**
```javascript
const groupedData = () => {
  const grouped = {};
  
  if (view === 'today' || view === 'week' || view === 'month') {
    // All views: group by course
    scheduleData.forEach(item => {
      const courseName = item.course.name;
      if (!grouped[courseName]) {
        grouped[courseName] = [];
      }
      grouped[courseName].push(item);
    });
    // ... sorting logic ...
  }
  return grouped;
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const groupedData = () => {
  const grouped = {};
  
  if (view === 'today' || view === 'week' || view === 'month') {
    // All views: group by course, excluding completed activities
    scheduleData.forEach(item => {
      // Skip completed activities
      const isCompleted = progress[item.activity_id]?.completed || false;
      if (isCompleted) {
        return; // Skip this item - don't add to grouped data
      }
      
      const courseName = item.course.name;
      if (!grouped[courseName]) {
        grouped[courseName] = [];
      }
      grouped[courseName].push(item);
    });
    // ... sorting logic ...
  }
  return grouped;
};
```

**Impact**: Completed activities are now filtered out before grouping, so they never appear in any view.

### 2. Updated Summary Alert (Lines 330-389)

**Purpose**: Show meaningful progress information that reflects incomplete vs. completed activities.

**New Variables Added:**
```javascript
const totalActivities = scheduleData.length;
const completedActivities = scheduleData.filter(s => progress[s.activity_id]?.completed).length;
const incompleteActivities = totalActivities - completedActivities;
const displayedActivitiesCount = Object.values(grouped).reduce((sum, items) => sum + items.length, 0);
```

**Summary Alert Changes:**

**Before:**
```javascript
{totalActivities > 0 && (
  <Alert severity="info" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
    {completedActivities} of {totalActivities} activities completed
    {completedActivities === totalActivities && " üéâ"}
  </Alert>
)}
```

**After:**
```javascript
{totalActivities > 0 && (
  <Alert severity={incompleteActivities === 0 ? "success" : "info"} sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
    {incompleteActivities === 0 
      ? `All ${totalActivities} activities completed! üéâ` 
      : `${incompleteActivities} ${incompleteActivities === 1 ? 'activity' : 'activities'} remaining (${completedActivities} completed)`
    }
  </Alert>
)}
```

**Impact**: 
- Shows "X activities remaining (Y completed)" during progress
- Changes to green success alert with "All X activities completed! üéâ" when done
- Proper singular/plural grammar ("1 activity" vs "2 activities")

---

### 3. Updated Empty State Display (Lines 395-405)

**Purpose**: Distinguish between "no activities scheduled" vs. "all activities completed".

**Before:**
```javascript
{totalActivities === 0 ? (
  <Card>
    <CardContent>
      <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary" align="center">
        No activities scheduled for this {view === 'today' ? 'day' : view === 'week' ? 'week' : 'month'}.
      </Typography>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
) : (
  // ... render activities ...
)}
```

**After:**
```javascript
{displayedActivitiesCount === 0 ? (
  <Card>
    <CardContent>
      <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary" align="center">
        {totalActivities === 0 
          ? `No activities scheduled for this ${view === 'today' ? 'day' : view === 'week' ? 'week' : 'month'}.`
          : `All activities completed for this ${view === 'today' ? 'day' : view === 'week' ? 'week' : 'month'}! üéâ`
        }
      </Typography>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
) : (
  // ... render activities ...
)}
```

**Impact**: 
- Shows celebratory message when all activities are completed
- Shows informational message when nothing is scheduled
- Uses `displayedActivitiesCount` instead of `totalActivities` to check if anything should be shown

## User Experience

### Before (With Checkboxes Showing):
```
My Schedule - Today

‚ÑπÔ∏è 2 of 5 activities completed

üìö Integrated Math 3
  ‚òëÔ∏è Quadratic Equations Review      [Completed]
  ‚ñ°  Polynomial Division Practice
  ‚òëÔ∏è Chapter 5 Practice Problems     [Completed]

üìö US History
  ‚ñ°  Civil War Essay
  ‚ñ°  Reconstruction Timeline
```

### After (Completed Activities Hidden):
```
My Schedule - Today

‚ÑπÔ∏è 3 activities remaining (2 completed)

üìö Integrated Math 3
  ‚ñ°  Polynomial Division Practice

üìö US History

```

### When All Activities Completed:
```
My Schedule - Today

‚úÖ All 5 activities completed! üéâ

[Empty card with celebration message]
All activities completed for this day! üéâ
```

---

## Behavior Details

### Completion Flow:
1. Student checks off an activity (clicks checkbox)
2. `handleActivityComplete()` updates the database
3. Progress state updates in React
4. `groupedData()` re-runs automatically (React re-render)
5. Completed activity is filtered out
6. Activity **disappears immediately** from the view
7. Summary updates to show remaining count
8. If course group becomes empty (all activities completed), entire course card disappears
9. If all activities completed, celebration message appears

### Real-time Updates:
- Changes are **instant** - no page refresh needed
- Uses React state management for smooth UX
- Database updates happen in background
- No loading spinners or delays visible to user

### Multi-View Consistency:
- Filtering applies to **all three views** (today, week, month)
- Overdue activities still appear (if incomplete)
- Switching between views maintains filter behavior
- Navigation (previous/next day/week/month) maintains filter behavior

---

## Database Impact

**No changes to database queries or schema.**

- Still fetches all scheduled activities (completed + incomplete)
- Filtering happens in JavaScript after data is retrieved
- Progress tracking table remains unchanged
- No additional queries needed

**Performance**: Filtering happens in-memory on client side, so performance impact is negligible (even with 100+ activities).

---

## Timezone Safety

‚úÖ **No changes to timezone handling** - all existing date safety features remain:
- Uses `getTodayString()` for local timezone
- Uses `createLocalDate()` for display
- Uses `formatDateForDB()` for storage
- No UTC conversions in filtering logic

---
