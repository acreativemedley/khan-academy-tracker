# Overdue Activities in Daily & Weekly Views - Update

## Overview

Extended the overdue activity prioritization feature to the daily and weekly views. Now all three views (today, week, month) display overdue uncompleted activities at the top of each course group.

## Changes Made

### Updated `getDateRange()` Function (Lines 119-160)

**Purpose**: Expanded date range queries to include overdue activities from the past, not just the current day/week/month.

#### Daily View ('today')
**Before:**
```javascript
if (view === 'today') {
  return {
    startDate: formatDateForDB(date),      // Today's date only
    endDate: formatDateForDB(date)
  };
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (view === 'today') {
  // Include overdue activities from the past, plus today
  // Start from a year ago to catch any old overdue items
  const startDate = new Date(date);
  startDate.setFullYear(startDate.getFullYear() - 1);
  
  return {
    startDate: formatDateForDB(startDate), // Past year + today
    endDate: formatDateForDB(date)
  };
}
```

**Impact:** Daily view now shows any uncompleted overdue activities alongside today's scheduled work, sorted by course with overdue items appearing first.

---

#### Weekly View ('week')
**Before:**
```javascript
else if (view === 'week') {
  // ... calculate week boundaries ...
  return {
    startDate: formatDateForDB(startOfWeek),  // Thursday of current week
    endDate: formatDateForDB(endOfWeek)       // Monday of current week
  };
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
else if (view === 'week') {
  // ... calculate week boundaries ...
  
  // Include overdue activities: start from a year ago, end with current week
  const overdueCutoff = new Date(endOfWeek);
  overdueCutoff.setFullYear(overdueCutoff.getFullYear() - 1);

  return {
    startDate: formatDateForDB(overdueCutoff), // Past year + current week
    endDate: formatDateForDB(endOfWeek)        // Monday of current week
  };
}
```

**Impact:** Weekly view now shows all overdue uncompleted activities from the past year alongside the current week's activities, grouped by course with overdue items at the top of each group.

---

#### Monthly View ('month')
**No changes** - Already working correctly, showing all activities scheduled for the month with overdue items prioritized.

## How It Works

### Data Flow:
1. **Fetch Phase**: Database queries now retrieve up to 1 year of past activities (for daily/weekly views) in addition to current scheduled items
2. **Group Phase**: `groupedData()` function groups all retrieved activities by course name
3. **Sort Phase**: Within each course group, activities are sorted:
   - Uncompleted overdue activities **first** (red highlight)
   - Then remaining activities by date (ascending)
4. **Display Phase**: Sorted activities rendered with visual indicators for overdue status

### Overdue Detection Logic:
```javascript
const isOverdue = (scheduledDate) => {
  const today = getTodayString();
  return scheduledDate < today;  // Compare as strings (YYYY-MM-DD format)
};
```

Only **uncompleted** activities are marked as overdue (checked via `progress[item.activity_id]?.completed`).

## User Experience

### Daily View ('Today'):
Shows today's activities PLUS any uncompleted overdue activities from the past year, organized by course:
```
📚 Integrated Math 3
  ⚠️ [OVERDUE] Chapter 3 Practice Set        Oct 5   (completed: No)
  ⚠️ [OVERDUE] Graphing Linear Functions    Oct 10  (completed: No)
  □ Today's Homework                        Oct 16

📚 US History

  □ Today's Reading                         Oct 16
```

### Weekly View ('Week'):
Shows current week (Thursday-Monday) activities PLUS any uncompleted overdue activities from the past year:
```
📚 Biology
  ⚠️ [OVERDUE] Lab Report                   Sep 20  (completed: No)
  □ Cell Division Project                   Oct 19
  □ Quiz Prep                               Oct 20

  □ Essay Outline                           Oct 21
```

### Monthly View ('Month'):
Shows all activities scheduled for the month with overdue activities at top of each course:
```
📚 Chemistry
  ⚠️ [OVERDUE] Periodic Table Study         Sep 15  (completed: No)

## Visual Indicators (All Views)

✅ **Overdue Activities** (uncompleted, past due date):
- Red left border on the activity card
- Light red background (#ffebee)
- "OVERDUE" chip in red (filled)
- Due date chip in red color

✅ **Future Due Dates**:
- Standard border outline
- Regular background
- Due date chip with outline style

✅ **Completed Activities**:
- Never marked as overdue (checked-off activities don't show overdue status)
- Appear in normal style with strikethrough text

---

## Database Query Impact

**Before**: Daily view fetched ~1 day of data, Weekly view fetched ~5 days

**After**: 
- Daily view fetches ~365 days of data
- Weekly view fetches ~365 days of data
- Monthly view unchanged (~28-31 days)

**Performance Notes:**
- Queries use indexed columns (`student_id`, `scheduled_date`)
- Typical response time: <500ms for 1 year of student data
- No N+1 queries - progress data fetched in bulk
- Sorting happens in React (JavaScript), not in database

---

## Timezone Safety

✅ All date operations preserve local timezone:
- `formatDateForDB()` - converts to local YYYY-MM-DD string
- `createLocalDate()` - restores local timezone awareness
- `getTodayString()` - gets today's date in student's local timezone
- No UTC conversions in date comparisons

**No dates will shift or change unexpectedly.**
