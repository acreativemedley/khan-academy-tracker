# Khan Academy Multi-Course Academic Planner
## Comprehensive Project Plan

**Project Goal:** Create a comprehensive React web application with Supabase backend to plan, schedule, and track progress across multiple Khan Academy courses with automated calendar generation and progress monitoring. The application will be deployed on Netlify and provide separate interfaces for students and administrators.

- Activities to Schedule: 204 activities (excluding 10 unit tests)
- Exam Days: 10 dedicated exam days
- Review Days: 10 review days before exams
- Available Study Days: ~153 days (173 - 10 - 10)
- **Daily Workload: ~1.3 activities/day** (204 ÷ 153)

**Integrated Math 3:**
- Activities to Schedule: 350 activities (excluding 13 unit tests)
- Exam Days: 13 dedicated exam days  
- Review Days: 13 review days before exams
