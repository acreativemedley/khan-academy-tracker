# Weekly Schedule Update - Changes Made

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Component**: `DailyScheduleView.jsx`  
**Changes**: 2 major features implemented

---

## ✅ Change 1: Week Now Runs Thursday-Monday

### What Changed
The weekly schedule view now starts on **Thursday** and ends on **Monday** (previously Sunday-Saturday).

### How It Works
- **Smart calculation**: Uses modulo arithmetic to find the most recent Thursday
- **Day mapping**:
  - Thursday (day 4) → 0 days back
  - Friday (day 5) → 1 day back
  - Saturday (day 6) → 2 days back
  - Sunday (day 0) → 3 days back
  - Monday (day 1) → 4 days back
  - Tuesday (day 2) → 5 days back
  - Wednesday (day 3) → 6 days back

### Code Location
- **Function**: `getDateRange()` (lines 119-147)
- **Key Logic**: 
  ```javascript
  const daysToThursday = (dayOfWeek + 3) % 7;
  startOfWeek.setDate(date.getDate() - daysToThursday);
  ```

### Date Range Navigation
- Previous/Next buttons now move by 1 week (5 days)
- Label shows "Thu, Oct 17 - Mon, Oct 21" format

## ✅ Change 2: Week View Now Groups by Course

### What Changed
When viewing the **Week** view, tasks are now grouped by **Course** with **due date chips** instead of being grouped by date.

### Display Format
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Integrated Math 3                │
│ ├─ Task 1  [Due: Oct 18]        │
│ ├─ Task 2  [Due: Oct 19]        │
│ └─ Task 3  [Due: Oct 21]        │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Physics                          │
│ ├─ Lab Report  [Due: Oct 17]    │
│ └─ Quiz Prep   [Due: Oct 20]    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Features
- ✅ **Grouped by Course**: All tasks for a course appear together
- ✅ **Due Date Chips**: Each task shows its due date
- ✅ **Color Coded**: Overdue tasks show red date chips
- ✅ **Sortable**: Courses appear in the order data is received
- ✅ **Checkbox Support**: Tasks can still be marked complete

### Code Location
- **Function**: `groupedData()` (lines 267-296)
- **Rendering**: Lines 364-407 (conditional rendering for week view)

## 🔐 Timezone Preservation

### How Dates Are Protected
All date handling uses these safe functions:

1. **`formatDateForDB(date)`**: Converts to YYYY-MM-DD (local time)
2. **`createLocalDate(dateString)`**: Creates date from YYYY-MM-DD (no timezone conversion)
3. **`getTodayString()`**: Returns today's date in YYYY-MM-DD (local time)

### What This Means
- ✅ No UTC conversion
- ✅ All dates stored and displayed in local timezone
- ✅ Week boundaries respect local time
- ✅ Dates won't shift when navigating between views

---

## 📊 Impact on Views

| View | Grouping | Date Format | Changes |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Today** | Course | N/A | None |
| **Week** | Course | Due date chips | ✅ NEW |
| **Month** | Date | Full date | None |

---

## 🎨 Visual Changes in Week View

### Task Card Layout
```
[Checkbox] Activity Name        [Due Date] [EXAM] [OVERDUE]
```

### Due Date Chip
- **Normal**: Light gray background, black text
- **Overdue**: Red background, white text

### Course Headers
- Bold blue text showing course name
- Clear visual separation between courses

---

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios
1. **Navigate weeks**: Use previous/next buttons
   - ✅ Should show Thursday-Monday correctly
   - ✅ Labels should update

2. **Current week view**:
   - ✅ Tasks grouped by course
   - ✅ Due dates showing on chips
   - ✅ Overdue tasks showing red

3. **Complete tasks**:
   - ✅ Checkboxes work per task
   - ✅ Completion date recorded correctly

4. **Timezone edge cases**:
   - ✅ If on Wednesday, "Next week" should show next Thursday
   - ✅ Dates should never shift

---

## 📝 Code Quality Notes

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ All date operations use safe utility functions
- ✅ No direct Date math across timezones
- ✅ Grouping logic is clear and maintainable
- ✅ Conditional rendering is explicit (not nested ternaries)
- ✅ Comments explain the day calculation

### Performance
- ✅ Grouping happens client-side (fast)
- ✅ No additional API calls needed
- ✅ Same data structure, different grouping logic
