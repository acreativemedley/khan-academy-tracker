## 🚀 QUICK START - First Deployment

### **STEP 1: Read the Main Guide** (~10 minutes)
Open and read: `tracker/deploy/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`

This will tell you to:
1. Create subdomain: matthew.makealltheprojects.com (in DreamHost panel)
2. Set up SSH keys (you may already have them from staff-scheduler)
3. Build your app locally (`npm install` && `npm run build`)

### **STEP 2: Run the Deploy Script** (~2-5 minutes)
In PowerShell (in your tracker folder):

```powershell
.\deploy\deploy.ps1 -RemoteUser dh_k773dx -RemoteHost vps30327.dreamhostps.com -RemotePath /home/dh_k773dx/matthew.makealltheprojects.com -KeyPath $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519
```

**Replace these if different**:
- `dh_k773dx` → Your SSH username
- `vps30327.dreamhostps.com` → Your VPS host
- `/home/dh_k773dx/matthew.makealltheprojects.com` → Your web directory

### **STEP 3: Test** (~5 minutes)
Visit: https://matthew.makealltheprojects.com

✅ Done! Your app is live!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't modify WordPress files at `/home/dh_k773dx/www`
- ❌ Don't delete the `.htaccess` file after uploading
- ❌ Don't share your SSH private key

### What You're NOT Changing
- ✅ Your main site (www.makealltheprojects.com) - UNTOUCHED
- ✅ Your staff-scheduler (scheduler.makealltheprojects.com) - UNTOUCHED
- ✅ Your Netlify deployment - STAYS ACTIVE
- ✅ Your WordPress installation - COMPLETELY SEPARATE

### Performance & Caching
- **First visit**: Load all assets (normal)
- **Subsequent visits**: Uses browser cache (1 year expiry for static assets)
- **Code changes**: Always checked (HTML never cached)
- **Clear cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete if needed
