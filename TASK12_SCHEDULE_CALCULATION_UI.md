**Status:** Implemented and Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

Added "Calculate Schedule" button to TargetDateSettings component, enabling users to generate schedules for their courses directly from the UI.

---

## Changes Made

### File Modified: `src/components/TargetDateSettings.jsx`

#### New Imports
```javascript
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogContent,
  DialogContentText,
  DialogActions,
  List,
  ListItem,
  ListItemText
} from '@mui/material';
import CalendarTodayIcon from '@mui/icons-material/CalendarToday';
import WarningIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Warning';
import { calculateSchedule, deleteScheduleForCourse } from '../services/scheduleService';
```

#### New State Variables
```javascript
const [studentId, setStudentId] = useState(null);
const [calculatingCourse, setCalculatingCourse] = useState(null);
const [scheduleResult, setScheduleResult] = useState(null);
const [confirmDialog, setConfirmDialog] = useState({ 
  open: false, 
  courseId: null, 
  courseName: null 
});
```

#### New Functions

1. **`loadStudentId()`**
   - Fetches authenticated student's ID
   - Called on component mount
   - Required for schedule calculation

2. **`handleCalculateSchedule(courseId, courseName, hasExistingSchedule)`**
   - Triggered when user clicks "Calculate Schedule" button
   - Shows confirmation dialog if schedule might exist
   - Calls execution function

3. **`executeCalculateSchedule(courseId, courseName)`**
   - Calls `calculateSchedule()` from scheduleService
   - Stores result in state
   - Displays success/warning alert with details

4. **`handleRecalculate()`**
   - Deletes existing schedule
   - Calculates new schedule
   - Closes confirmation dialog

**After (when target date exists):**
- "Calculate Schedule" button with calendar icon
- Loading state with spinner during calculation
- Disabled state while any calculation is running

### Schedule Result Display

After successful calculation, displays detailed alert with:

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Total activities count
- Regular activities count
- Exam activities count
- School days available
- Daily target (activities per day)
- First activity date
- Last activity date

**Warnings (if any):**
- Past date warnings
- Insufficient days warnings
- Other scheduling conflicts

**Actions:**
- "View Course Schedule" button (navigates to CourseDetail)
- Close button (dismiss alert)

### Confirmation Dialog

**Triggered when:** User clicks "Calculate Schedule" for course with possible existing schedule

**Dialog Content:**
- Title: "Recalculate Schedule?"
- Warning: Explains manual overrides will be lost
- Note: Incomplete activities will be rescheduled
- Actions: Cancel / Recalculate Schedule

1. User sets target date for "Math - Unit 1"
2. Clicks "Calculate Schedule" button
3. System shows confirmation dialog
4. User clicks "Recalculate Schedule"
5. System:
   - Deletes any existing schedule
   - Calculates new schedule with 104 activities
   - Distributes across school days
   - Shows success alert with details
6. User clicks "View Course Schedule" to see results

### Scenario 2: Recalculation

1. User changes target date from 5/30/2026 to 6/15/2026
2. Clicks "Calculate Schedule" button
3. Sees confirmation dialog warning about manual overrides
4. Confirms recalculation
5. System recalculates with new target date

## Integration Points

### Dependencies

**Services:**
- `scheduleService.calculateSchedule()` - Core algorithm
- `scheduleService.deleteScheduleForCourse()` - Clear existing
- `supabase.auth.getUser()` - Get authenticated user
- `supabase.from('students')` - Get student ID

**Utilities:**
- `formatDateForDisplay()` - Format dates for UI

**Components:**
- Material-UI Dialog components
- Material-UI Alert components
- React Router navigation

### Next Steps Integration

This component feeds into:
- **Task 10:** CourseDetail will display the schedules created here
- **Task 13:** DailyScheduleView will show today's scheduled activities
- **Task 14:** Schedule adherence metrics will track progress against these schedules

---

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps

- [ ] **Load Component**
  - Navigate to Target Date Settings
  - Verify all courses load
  - Verify student ID loads

- [ ] **Set Target Date**
  - Pick a course without target date
  - Set target date in the future
  - Verify "Calculate Schedule" button appears

- [ ] **Calculate Schedule - First Time**
  - Click "Calculate Schedule" button
  - Verify confirmation dialog appears
  - Click "Recalculate Schedule"
  - Verify calculation starts (button shows loading)
  - Wait for completion
  - Verify success alert displays
  - Check all metrics are shown correctly

- [ ] **Verify Warnings**
  - Set target date in the past
  - Calculate schedule
  - Verify warnings appear in alert

- [ ] **Verify Database**
  - Open Supabase dashboard
  - Check `schedule` table
  - Verify records created for course
  - Check `scheduled_date` values
  - Verify `is_exam_day` flags

- [ ] **Recalculate**
  - Change target date
  - Click "Calculate Schedule" again
  - Confirm dialog warning about manual overrides
  - Proceed with recalculation
  - Verify new schedule replaces old

- [ ] **Navigate to Course**
  - Click "View Course Schedule" button

  - (Task 10 will show the schedule here)

- [ ] **Edge Cases**
  - Try with course having 0 activities
  - Try with very short timeframe
  - Try with target date = today

---

## Database Impact

### Tables Modified

**`schedule` table:**
- Inserts 100+ rows per course calculation
- Each row contains:
  - `student_id` - Links to student
  - `course_id` - Links to course
  - `activity_id` - Links to specific activity
  - `scheduled_date` - Calculated due date
  - `is_exam_day` - TRUE for exam activities
  - `order_in_day` - For multiple activities same day
  - `manually_assigned` - FALSE (auto-calculated)

### Expected Data

**Example for Math Unit 1:**
- Total rows: 104 (100 regular + 4 exams)
- Date range: ~Today to 5/30/2026
- Distribution: ~1-2 activities per school day
- Exam days: Dedicated days after unit completion

---

## Known Issues / Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **No Progress Preservation**
   - Recalculation doesn't preserve completed activities
   - Future: Keep completed items, only reschedule incomplete

2. **No Vacation Impact Choice**
   - Automatically excludes vacations
   - Future: Task 17 will add strategy selection

3. **No Activity Preview**
   - Can't preview schedule before confirming
   - Future: Add preview mode

### Future Enhancements (Other Tasks)

- **Task 8:** Add vacation management (impacts schedule)
- **Task 10:** Display schedules in CourseDetail
- **Task 11:** Manual date overrides
- **Task 13:** Daily schedule view
- **Task 17:** Vacation impact strategies
