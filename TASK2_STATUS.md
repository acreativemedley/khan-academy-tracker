## ðŸ”„ Task 2: Create Parent Account

**Options for You:**

### Option A: I'll create it now (Recommended)
You can create the parent account via **Supabase Dashboard**:
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** â†’ **Users**
3. Click **"Add User"**
4. Email: `feltiefun@gmail.com`
5. Password: Your choice
6. Check "Email Confirm" âœ“
7. Click Save

**This takes 1 minute and gives you clean parent-only auth.**

### Option B: Create via UI
Use the Test Student page to create another account (will create student profile too).

## ðŸš€ What I Can Do Next (No User Input Needed)

While you create the parent account (or we can skip it for now), I can proceed with **database setup tasks** that don't require your interaction:

### Task 3: Create vacation_periods Table
- SQL migration to create new table
- Add foreign keys and indexes
- Ready for vacation management feature

### Task 4: Add manually_assigned Column to schedule
- Alter schedule table
- Add boolean column for tracking manual overrides
- Set default to FALSE

### Task 5: Build Date Calculation Utilities
- Create `utils/scheduleUtils.js`
- Implement helper functions for date calculations
- School day logic, vacation checking, etc.

## Your Choice

**Would you like me to:**

1. **Wait** for you to create parent account, then proceed with Tasks 3-5?

2. **Proceed now** with Tasks 3-5 (database & utilities) while you create parent account separately?

3. **Skip parent account** for now and move directly to building the scheduling system?

---

## Recommendation

**I recommend Option 2:**
- I proceed with Tasks 3-5 (database setup and utilities)
- You create parent account via Supabase Dashboard when convenient
- These tasks are independent and will save time
- Parent account can be added anytime without blocking development

---

**Let me know how you'd like to proceed!**

All database tasks are ready to execute and don't require your input.
