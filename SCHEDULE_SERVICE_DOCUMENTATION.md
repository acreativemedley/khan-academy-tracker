# Schedule Service Documentation

**Status:** Complete

## Overview

The Schedule Service implements the core scheduling algorithm that distributes course activities across available school days. It handles fractional daily targets, exam scheduling, vacation exclusions, and manual overrides.

**Key Principle:** NO TIME TRACKING - Only activity completion tracking by date

---

## Core Functions

### 1. calculateSchedule(courseId, studentId, options)

**Purpose:** Calculate and assign due dates for all activities in a course

**Parameters:**
- `courseId` (string) - UUID of the course
- `studentId` (string) - UUID of the student
- `options` (object)
  - `forceRecalculate` (boolean) - Delete existing schedule and recalculate

**Algorithm:**
1. Fetch course, student, activities, and vacation data
2. Validate target completion date exists
3. Calculate available school days (excluding vacations)
4. Separate exams from regular activities
5. Calculate activities per day (handles fractional distribution)
6. Distribute extra activities evenly using interval calculation
7. Assign due dates to all activities
8. Place exams on dedicated days after their unit
9. Insert assignments into schedule table

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  assignmentsCreated: 100,
  startDate: "2025-10-05",
  endDate: "2026-05-30",
  regularActivitiesScheduled: 95,
  examsScheduled: 5,
  averageActivitiesPerDay: 1.25,
  schoolDaysUsed: 80,
  warnings: ["⚠️ 3 activities scheduled for past dates"]
}
```

---

### 2. getScheduleForCourse(courseId, studentId)

**Purpose:** Retrieve all scheduled activities for a specific course

**Returns:** Array of schedule records with joined activity data

**Usage:**
```javascript
const schedule = await getScheduleForCourse(courseId, studentId);
```

---

### 3. getTodaySchedule(studentId)

**Purpose:** Get all activities scheduled for today across all courses

**Returns:** Array of today's activities grouped by course

**Usage:**
```javascript
const todayTasks = await getTodaySchedule(studentId);
```

---

### 4. getScheduleForDateRange(studentId, startDate, endDate)

**Purpose:** Get scheduled activities within a date range

**Parameters:**
- `studentId` (string)
- `startDate` (Date)
- `endDate` (Date)

**Usage:**
```javascript
const weekSchedule = await getScheduleForDateRange(
  studentId,
  new Date('2025-10-05'),
  new Date('2025-10-11')
);
```

---

### 5. overrideActivityDate(activityId, studentId, newDate)

**Purpose:** Manually change an activity's due date

**Sets:** `manually_assigned = true`

**Usage:**
```javascript
await overrideActivityDate(activityId, studentId, new Date('2025-10-15'));
```

---

### 6. deleteScheduleForCourse(courseId, studentId)

**Purpose:** Delete all schedule records for a course (used before recalculation)

**Usage:**
```javascript
await deleteScheduleForCourse(courseId, studentId);
```

---

## Fractional Distribution Algorithm

**Problem:** When activities/day = 1.25, how to distribute?

**Solution:** Even distribution using interval calculation

**Example:**
- 100 activities over 80 school days = 1.25 per day
- Base: 1 activity per day
- Extra: 20 activities need to be distributed
- Interval: 80 ÷ 20 = 4
- Result: Every 4th day gets 2 activities instead of 1

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const baseActivities = Math.floor(activitiesPerDay);
const extraActivities = totalActivities - (totalDays * baseActivities);
const extraInterval = Math.floor(totalDays / extraActivities);

// On day X:
if (dayIndex % extraInterval === 0 && extraAssigned < extraActivities) {
  activitiesForDay++;
  extraAssigned++;
}
```

---

## Exam Scheduling Logic

**Rules:**
1. Exams are placed AFTER all activities in their unit
2. Exams get a dedicated day (is_exam_day = true)
3. Only one exam per day per course
4. Other courses can have activities on exam days

**Function:** `findExamForActivityIndex()`

**Process:**
1. After scheduling activities, check current position
2. Find exam in same unit that comes next
3. Verify no activities between current position and exam
4. Schedule exam on next available day
5. Mark as exam day

---

## Vacation Handling

Vacation periods are automatically excluded from available school days:

```javascript
const availableDays = getSchoolDaysInRange(
  startDate,
  targetDate,
  student.school_days,
  vacations  // ← Automatically excluded
);
```

**Impact:**
- Activities never scheduled on vacation days
- Calculation adjusts automatically
- Maintains target completion date

---

## Manual Override Behavior

**When user manually changes a date:**
1. `manually_assigned` flag set to TRUE
2. Override persists until recalculation
3. On recalculate, all manual dates are reset
4. User warned before recalculation if manual dates exist

**Query for manual overrides:**
```javascript
const manualCount = await supabase
  .from('schedule')
  .select('count')
  .eq('course_id', courseId)
  .eq('student_id', studentId)
  .eq('manually_assigned', true);
```

---

## Past Date Handling

**Behavior:**
- System allows past date assignments
- Useful for mid-year setup
- Warning displayed showing count

**Warning:**
```
⚠️ 15 activities are scheduled for past dates.
These will show as overdue until marked complete.
```

---

## Error Handling

**Common Errors:**
- `Course must have a target completion date`
- `No activities found for this course`
- `Target completion date must be after start date`
- `No available school days between start and target date`
- `Not enough school days to schedule all activities and exams`

All errors return:
```javascript
{
  success: false,
  error: "Error message",
  assignmentsCreated: 0
}
```

---

## Database Interactions

**Tables Used:**
- `courses` - Course configuration
- `students` - School days configuration
- `activities` - Activities to schedule
- `vacation_periods` - Days to exclude
- `schedule` - Output: scheduled assignments

**Schedule Record:**
```javascript
{
  id: UUID,
  student_id: UUID,
  activity_id: UUID,
  course_id: UUID,
  scheduled_date: "2025-10-15",
  is_exam_day: false,
  is_review_day: false,
  order_in_day: 1,
  manually_assigned: false,
  created_at: TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
}
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Calculate Schedule for New Course

```javascript
import { calculateSchedule } from '../services/scheduleService';

const result = await calculateSchedule(courseId, studentId);

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`✅ ${result.assignmentsCreated} activities scheduled`);
  console.log(`Average: ${result.averageActivitiesPerDay} per day`);
  
  if (result.warnings.length > 0) {
    result.warnings.forEach(w => console.warn(w));
  }
} else {
  console.error(`❌ ${result.error}`);
}
```

### Example 2: Recalculate Existing Schedule

```javascript
// Force recalculate (deletes existing schedule)
const result = await calculateSchedule(courseId, studentId, {
  forceRecalculate: true
});
```

### Example 3: Display Today's Tasks

```javascript
import { getTodaySchedule } from '../services/scheduleService';

const tasks = await getTodaySchedule(studentId);

tasks.forEach(task => {
  console.log(`${task.course.name}: ${task.activity.activity_name}`);
  console.log(`Type: ${task.activity.activity_type}`);
  console.log(`Exam Day: ${task.is_exam_day ? 'Yes' : 'No'}`);
});
```

### Example 4: Get Week Schedule

```javascript
import { getScheduleForDateRange } from '../services/scheduleService';

const today = new Date();
const nextWeek = new Date(today);
nextWeek.setDate(today.getDate() + 7);

const weekTasks = await getScheduleForDateRange(studentId, today, nextWeek);
```

### Example 5: Manual Date Override

```javascript
import { overrideActivityDate } from '../services/scheduleService';

// Move activity to different date
const success = await overrideActivityDate(
  activityId,
  studentId,
  new Date('2025-10-20')
);

if (success) {
  console.log('✅ Date overridden successfully');
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Calculate schedule with fractional activities per day
- [ ] Verify even distribution of extras
- [ ] Check exam scheduling after unit activities

## Performance Considerations

**Optimizations:**
- Activities fetched once, sorted by order_index
- Single batch insert for all assignments
- Indexed queries on schedule table
- Vacation periods cached per calculation

**Scalability:**
- Handles 500+ activities per course
- Processes in < 2 seconds typically
- Memory efficient (streaming not needed)

**Status:** ✅ Complete and ready for integration  
**Next Steps:** UI integration (Tasks 8-15)
