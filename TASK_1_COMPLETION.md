# Task 1 Completion Summary
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Task:** Create Test Student Profile  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Accomplished
- **Test student successfully created** in the database with proper authentication linkage
- **Progress tracking functionality verified** - users can check off activities and progress is saved
- **Database foreign key relationships confirmed** working correctly:
  - `progress_tracking.student_id` → `students.id` ✅
  - `progress_tracking.activity_id` → `activities.id` ✅  
  - `progress_tracking.course_id` → `courses.id` ✅

## Issues Resolved
- **Foreign key constraint error** initially encountered when checking activities
- **Debugging process established** to diagnose database constraint issues
- **Documentation updated** in copilot-instructions.md for future SQL debugging:
  - Added guidance on ambiguous column references in JOINs
  - Added information_schema table join patterns

## Technical Details

- Database constraints verified and working as expected

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with **Task 2: Import Integrated Math 3 Units 2-13** to add the remaining 329 activities from math-data-formatted.md to the database.
