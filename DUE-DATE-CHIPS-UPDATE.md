# Due Date Chips in All Schedule Views - Update

## Overview

Added due date chips to all schedule list items across daily, weekly, and monthly views. Previously, only week and month views showed due dates. Now the today view also displays due date chips for consistency and clarity.

## Changes Made

### Updated Activity List Item Rendering (Lines 444-450)

**Purpose**: Display the scheduled due date for every activity in all views.

**Before:**
```javascript
<FormControlLabel ... />
{(view === 'week' || view === 'month') && (
  <Chip 
    label={createLocalDate(item.scheduled_date).toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short', day: 'numeric' })}
    size="small"
    variant="outlined"
    color={isOverdue(item.scheduled_date) ? "error" : "default"}
  />
)}
{view !== 'today' && view !== 'week' && (
  <Chip 
    label={item.course.name}
    size="small"
    variant="outlined"
  />
)}
{item.activity.is_exam && ...}
```

**After:**
```javascript
<FormControlLabel ... />
{/* Due date chip - shown in all views */}
<Chip 
  label={createLocalDate(item.scheduled_date).toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short', day: 'numeric' })}
  size="small"
  variant="outlined"
  color={isOverdue(item.scheduled_date) ? "error" : "default"}
/>
{item.activity.is_exam && ...}
```

**Impact**: 
- Due date chips now appear in **all three views** (today, week, month)
- Removed the conditional logic that hid them in today view
- Removed the redundant course name chip (since views already group by course)
- Consistent visual design across all views

---

## Visual Design

### Chip Appearance:
- **Format**: "Oct 16" (short month + day number)
- **Size**: Small
- **Style**: Outlined border
- **Color**: 
  - **Red** (`error`) - for overdue dates (past today)
  - **Gray** (`default`) - for current or future dates

### Example Activity Display:
```
üìö Integrated Math 3
  ‚ñ° Quadratic Equations Review    Oct 16  [EXAM]
  ‚ñ° Polynomial Division Practice  Oct 18
  ‚ñ° Chapter 5 Practice Problems   Oct 12  [OVERDUE]  ‚Üê Red chips
```

## User Experience Impact

### Today View:
**Before:**
```
My Schedule - Today

üìö Integrated Math 3
  ‚ñ° Quadratic Equations Review
  ‚ñ° Practice Problems
```

**After:**
```
My Schedule - Today

üìö Integrated Math 3
  ‚ñ° Quadratic Equations Review    Oct 16
  ‚ñ° Practice Problems             Oct 16
```

Now students can see the exact due date even in today view, which is helpful for:
- Activities from previous days that are overdue
- Verifying which activities are due today vs. carried over
- Planning their work priorities

### Week View:
No change - already had due date chips

### Month View:
No change - already had due date chips

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Consistency** - All views now show the same information  
‚úÖ **Clarity** - Students always see when something is due  
‚úÖ **Overdue visibility** - Red chips make past-due items obvious  
‚úÖ **Simpler code** - Removed conditional rendering logic  
‚úÖ **Better UX** - Important date information always visible  

---

## Timezone Safety

‚úÖ **No changes to date handling** - uses existing safe functions:
- `createLocalDate(item.scheduled_date)` - preserves local timezone
- `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short', day: 'numeric' })` - formats in user's locale
- No UTC conversions

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Today view shows due date chips on all activities
- [ ] Week view shows due date chips (unchanged)
- [ ] Month view shows due date chips (unchanged)
- [ ] Overdue dates show in red
- [ ] Current/future dates show in gray
- [ ] Date format is "Oct 16" (short month + day)
- [ ] Chips wrap properly on small screens
- [ ] EXAM chip still appears for tests
- [ ] OVERDUE chip still appears for past-due items
