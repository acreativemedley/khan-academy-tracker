# NO TIME TRACKING - Cleanup Complete

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Issue:** `estimated_time` column references found in code  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

The database error showed:
```
column activities_1.estimated_time does not exist
```

This was caused by queries in `StudentDashboard.jsx` and display code in `CourseDetail.jsx` that referenced `estimated_time`, which violates the project's **NO TIME TRACKING** principle.

---

## Files Fixed

### 1. src/components/StudentDashboard.jsx

**Removed:**
- `estimated_time` from schedule query SELECT statement

**Fixed Timezone Issue:**
- Changed `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` to use `formatDateForDB()`
- Added import: `formatDateForDB` from dateUtils
- Ensures dates stay in America/Chicago timezone

**Before:**
```javascript
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
const { data: todayActivitiesData, error: scheduleError } = await supabase
  .from('schedule')
  .select(`
    id,
    scheduled_date,
    is_exam_day,
    is_review_day,
    activities!inner(
      id,
      activity_name,
      activity_type,
      estimated_time  // ❌ TIME TRACKING - REMOVED
    )
  `)
```

**After:**
```javascript
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const todayString = formatDateForDB(today);
const { data: todayActivitiesData, error: scheduleError } = await supabase
  .from('schedule')
  .select(`
    id,
    scheduled_date,
    is_exam_day,
    is_review_day,
    activities!inner(
      id,
      activity_name,
      activity_type
      // ✅ NO TIME FIELDS
    )
  `)
```

### 2. src/components/CourseDetail.jsx

**Removed:**
- Chip displaying `estimated_time` in minutes

**Before:**
```javascript
{activity.estimated_time && (
  <Chip 
    label={`${activity.estimated_time}min`}  // ❌ TIME TRACKING
    size="small" 
    variant="outlined"
  />
)}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// ✅ REMOVED - No time display
```

## Verification

### Searched Entire Codebase

**Search Terms:**
- `estimated_time` ✅ All removed
- `estimated_hours` ✅ None found
- `time_spent` ✅ None found  
- `duration` ✅ None found (except in comments explaining NO TIME TRACKING)
- `hours_spent` ✅ None found

**Only Remaining References:**
- Comments in `scheduleUtils.js` and `scheduleService.js` stating "NO TIME TRACKING"
- These are documentation, not code

## NO TIME TRACKING Policy

### What We DON'T Track:
- ❌ Time estimates
- ❌ Time spent on activities
- ❌ Duration of sessions
- ❌ Hours worked
- ❌ Minutes per activity
- ❌ Time goals
- ❌ Speed metrics

### What We DO Track:
- ✅ Activity completion (yes/no)
- ✅ Completion dates
- ✅ Due dates (scheduled_date)
- ✅ Progress percentages (count of completed activities)
- ✅ On-time vs overdue status
- ✅ Help requests (when stuck, not how long)

---

## Database Schema Note

The `activities` table in the database DOES have an `estimated_hours` column (INTEGER), but we **NEVER query it or display it** in the application.

This column may have been created early in development before the NO TIME TRACKING requirement was established. It exists but is unused.

### Recommendation

Consider removing the `estimated_hours` column from the database in a future migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE activities DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS estimated_hours;
```

This would prevent any future accidental usage.

## Timezone Fixes

Also fixed timezone issues where dates were being converted to UTC:

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]  // Converts to UTC!
new Date(dateString)  // Interprets as UTC midnight
```

### After (Correct):
```javascript
formatDateForDB(date)  // Keeps local timezone
createLocalDate(dateString)  // Creates date in local timezone
```

This prevents the "off by one day" error where October 5th in Chicago becomes October 6th in UTC.

---

## Testing

After these changes:

1. ✅ StudentDashboard should load without database errors
2. ✅ CourseDetail should display activities without time chips
3. ✅ Schedule queries should use correct date (2025-10-05, not 2025-10-06)
4. ✅ No "4 activities overdue" false warnings

---

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/StudentDashboard.jsx` - Removed `estimated_time` query, fixed timezone
2. `src/components/CourseDetail.jsx` - Removed time display chip

## Files Previously Modified (for timezone fixes)

3. `src/services/scheduleService.js` - All date handling uses `formatDateForDB()`
4. `src/components/TargetDateSettings.jsx` - Uses `createLocalDate()` for date parsing

---

**Status:** ✅ NO TIME TRACKING policy fully enforced  
**Timezone:** ✅ All dates use America/Chicago consistently  
**Ready:** ✅ App should work without errors now
